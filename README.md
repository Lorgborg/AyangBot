# AyangBot
A bot created for the DnD sessions in the sigma gang server

## Installation
Clone the GitHub into your local device and ask me for the .env file if you want to run the bot from your device. After this, run *npm install* to install all dependencies.

## Running the file
Run the file with the command *npm run start* in order to start the bot. If any changes are made towards the commands, run *npm run reload* in order to reload the commands. If changes arre not reflected, restart the bot.

## Making contributions
Commands must have their own folders within the commands folder. Like how ping.js is inside a folder named ping. Events are placed inside the events folder and not the index to ensure a clean main file.
