# AyangBot
A bot created for the DnD sessions in the sigma gang server

## Installation
Clone the GitHub into your local device and ask me for the .env file if you want to run the bot from your device. After this, run **npm install** to install all dependencies.

## Running the file
Run the file with the command **npm run start** in order to start the bot. If any changes are made towards the commands, run **npm run reload** in order to reload the commands. If changes arre not reflected, restart the bot.

## Making contributions
Commands must have their own folders within the commands folder. Like how ping.js is inside a folder named ping. Events are placed inside the events folder and not the index to ensure a clean main file.

## Current things needed help with

The bot is now in a usable state, all other possible contributions are just to make things look better and feel better.

## Additional functions
Custom message for when a character dies
A way to save character images, so that the embeds can include character messages (This can also be done manually, but ewwww)

### Thank you for your support!
