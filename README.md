# AyangBot
A bot created for the DnD sessions in the sigma gang server

## Installation
Clone the GitHub into your local device and ask me for the .env file if you want to run the bot from your device. After this, run **npm install** to install all dependencies.

## Running the file
Run the file with the command **npm run start** in order to start the bot. If any changes are made towards the commands, run **npm run reload** in order to reload the commands. If changes arre not reflected, restart the bot.

## Making contributions
Commands must have their own folders within the commands folder. Like how ping.js is inside a folder named ping. Events are placed inside the events folder and not the index to ensure a clean main file.

## Current things needed help with
**/help** command, hopefully embeded to help users navigate bot commands // works kinda

**/update** command, which should update a user's selected stat. Hopefully this is implemented with an embed or through dms. Or maybe both that's also cool

These are the required things for the bot to be considered ready for deployement.

## Additional functions
Custom message for when a character dies
A way to save character images, so that the embeds can include character messages (This can also be done manually, but ewwww)

### Thank you for your support!
